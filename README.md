### Hey, I'm Ahmed Baig! ✌

I work as a ~~web developer~~ ninja software engineer 💪. I´m based in Karachi, Pakistan.

Since 2015 I've been softwares and apps, experimenting with crazy architectures and best practices. I've had the chance to immerse myself in many different works and projects, helping to make this world a little better through design & code. ✨😍
